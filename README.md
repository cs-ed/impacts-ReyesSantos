# Impacts on Society

Computer Science Discovery

Computer Science Discovery targeting 9th and 10th grade students. Each day starts with a daily question for discussion. There are plenty of activities to promote discussion, learn from each other, and respect others opinion/creativity. Throughout the course 1-2 learning objectives per unit will be used as graded classroom discussion and reflection. The discussions will be student centered and strategically guided for  interaction in the class addressing equity, diversity, and inclusion.

Students will take time to write a reflection based on the discussions. Teacher feed back through journaling. Commending students on sharing and giving others the opportunity to share. Posing questions about what they share and the impacts on society.

### Learning Activities

The daily discussions will bring forward issues of  opportunity and to resolve these wihin our classroom.  Student will respectfully engage in discussion. I have experienced students willing to listen, learn, and change. 

### Assessment

As outlined the discussion participation and journal reflections will be graded based on a rubric. Reflection writing in a journal with teacher feed back.

### Outcomes

As our discussion progress throughtout the year we will see emerging patterns of diversity/equity/inclusion.  Student will share experiences, beliefs, and be able to respectfully hear others out. Student will be able to critically think about the validity of web information.  help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
