# Impacts on Society

Computer Science Discovery

Computer Science Discovery targeting 9th and 10th grade students. Each day starts with a daily question for discussion. There are plenty of activities to promote 
discussion, learn from each other, and respect others opinion/creativity. Throughout the course 1-2 learning objectives per unit will be used as graded classroom 
discussion and reflection. The discussions will be student centered and strategically guided for interaction in the class addressing equity, diversity, and inclusion.

Students will take time to write a reflection based on the discussions. Teacher feed back through journaling. Commending students on sharing and giving others the
opportunity to share. Posing questions about what they share and the impacts on society.

	 Class activity: Digital Footprint
	 The class begins by discussing what types of information they have shared on various websites, then they look at several sample social media pages
	 to see what types of personal information could be shared intentionally or unintentionally. Finally, the class comes up with a set of guidelines to follow 
	 putting information online. 
    Pair share and class discussion:

     Assessment: Reflection journal with teacher feedback
     Rubric: 1-4


	Class activity: Teams work together to set group norms and brainstorm what features they would like their websites to have. The class starts by reflecting on
	what makes teams successful. Teams then make plans for how they will interact and achieve success in their own projects before brainstorming ideas for their
	website projects.
	
	Pair share and class discussion: 
	What strategies can teams use to work better together?
        How do group norms compare to class norms?
              (Similarities and differences)
	
	Expectations: participate and adhere to established norms.
	Assessment: Reflection journal with teacher feedback
	Rubric: 1-4

Unit 3 - Interactive Animations and Games (9 Weeks)

	Class Activity: Exploring Websites
	This lesson covers the purposes that a web page might serve, both for the users and the creators. The class explores a handful of sample web pages and 	   
	describes how each of those pages is useful for users and how they might also serve their creators.
	Pair share and class discussion: How does programming enable creativity and individual 
	expression?
            *Target audience? Gender? Race? Income?

	Pair share and class discussion: 
	How do computer scientists identify the needs of their users?
            *Target audience? Gender? Race? Income?
            *How can I make this for you?
	          Research, data, analyze, report
                                                          
     Expectations: participate and adhere to established norms.
     Assessment: Reflection journal with teacher feedback
     Rubric: 1-4

Unit 5 - Data and Society (4 Weeks)
	
	How does data help us to solve problems?
        Pair share and class discussion: 
	What is data?
 	Students will begin to use gender, ethnicity, and underrepresented population to   
 	Drive discussion.                                                    
     	Expectations: participate and adhere to established norms.

	How do computers and humans use data differently?
	Pair share and class discussion: 
	Do computers care about age, gender or color?
	Do humans care about age, gender or color?

	Students will begin to see how data is aggregated by gender, ethnicity, under/over-represented population, and income.

### Learning Activities

The daily discussions will bring forward issues of  opportunity and to resolve these wihin our classroom.  Student will respectfully engage in discussion. I have experienced students willing to listen, learn, and change. 

### Assessment

As outlined the discussion participation and journal reflections will be graded based on a rubric. Reflection writing in a journal with teacher feed back.

### Outcomes

As our discussion progress throughtout the year we will see emerging patterns of diversity/equity/inclusion.  Student will share experiences, beliefs, and be able to respectfully hear others out. Student will be able to critically think about the validity of web information.  help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
